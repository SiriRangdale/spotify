##Spotify Genre-Based Insights using Medallion Architecture in Azure Databricks and Power BI

Objective:
To analyze a large Spotify dataset by applying the Medallion Architecture in Azure Databricks, standardize inconsistent genre values, and derive actionable insights using a Power BI dashboard.

Tools & Technologies:
Azure Databricks (PySpark & SQL) â€“ for data transformation

Medallion Architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold) â€“ for scalable data pipeline

Power BI â€“ for data visualization

GitHub â€“ for version control and collaboration

Dataset:
Source: Spotify dataset from Kaggle

Contains: Track metadata, artist info, popularity, energy, valence, tempo, and genre

Key Steps:
1. Bronze Layer â€“ Raw Data Ingestion
Loaded raw .csv file into Databricks.

Performed basic schema inference and initial validation.

Cleaned null values, corrected data types.

Standardized the genres column which had fragmented values (e.g., "dance pop", "alt z pop", "electropop") by grouping them into broad genres like Pop, Electronic, Hip-Hop, etc.

3. Gold Layer â€“ Business-Ready Data
Created a new column main_genre using SQL CASE WHEN logic to classify all sub-genres into ~10 main genres.
Added Other Use Cases such as Top 3 artsists based on Popularity and Followers as well.

Aggregated artist and track-level insights by genre.

4. Power BI Dashboard
Imported Gold data.
Created interactive visuals:
Top genres by unique artist count
Top 3 artsists based on Popularity
